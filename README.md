I'm Luca Scalambrin, a student of Telecommunications Engineering at Balseiro Institute, Bariloche - Argentina. I really enjoy interconnecting different technologies and making them work. Most of the scripts that I write are in C or python. Iâ€™m also interested in AI applications, deep learning in particular, and data science. Currently I am working on my final project, which is about classifying different types of crop from Satellite images(Sentinel-2) using deep learning techniques.
