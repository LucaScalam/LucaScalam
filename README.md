I'm Luca Scalambrin, a Telecommunications engineer who graduated from "Instituto Balseiro" in Bariloche, Argentina. My passion lies in interconnecting diverse technologies and ensuring they function seamlessly.  I predominantly write code in C and Python (mostly in C). Alongside this, I hold a strong fascination in AI applications, particularly in deep learning and data science. At the moment, I serve as a firmware and innovation engineer at Worldsensing SL. Simultaneously, I am pursuing a PhD supported by a Marie Curie fellowship obtained in 2022, within the framework of the European GreenEdge ITN project.
